# Movie Sentiment Analysis

In this project we scrap the IMBD comments of the movie entered by the user and analyse them using logistic regression with 88.8% accuracy.

The project includes the User Interface built using Streamlit and the backend using Python with logistic regression as the ML model.

The model is trained on IMDB dataset consisting on 50k comments. The trained model is saved and loaded in the app.py file already.
